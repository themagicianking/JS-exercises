// Exercise 1. Simply declare a variable named 'emptyVariable'

let emptyVariable;

// Exercise 2. Declare a variable called 'myName'

let myName;

// Exercise 3. Assign your name as the value for 'myName'

myName = "Thane";

// Exercise 4. Declare a variable called dreamDestination and give it the value
// of what your dream vacation destination is.

let dreamDestination = "New Orleans";

// Exercise 5. Make the following variables and assignments
// - a variable called num1 with a value greater than 1 and less than 10
// - a variable called num2 with a value of greater than or equal to 1 and less
// than or equal to 10

let num1 = 6;
let num2 = 3;

// Exercise 6. Write a comment below explaining the difference between the rules
// for num1 and num2 from Exercise 5. What numbers would be valid values for
// num2 but not num1?

// For num1, a value greater than 1 and less than 10 necessarily excludes both 1
// and 10, meaning the valid numbers would be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
// For num2, a value greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10
// includes both numbers, meaning the valid numbers would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
// 7, 8, 9, and 10.

// Exercise 7. Now we will try some addition.
// a. Assign the the values of 4 and 6 to num1 and num2, respectively.
// b. Make a new variable called 'theSum', and use 'num1' and
// 'num2' to assign its value using the "+" operator.

num1 = 4;
num2 = 6;
let theSum = num1 + num2;

// Exercise 8. Now we will try some multiplication.
// Make a new variable called 'theProduct', multiply num1 and num2 and assign
// the resulting value to 'theProduct'.

let theProduct = num1 * num2;

// Exercise 9.
// Make a new variable called 'statement' and using 'myName' and
// 'dreamDestination' and the concatenation method of your choice, make the
// value of statement to be:
// "Hi, my name is <your name>, and I can't wait to visit <your destination>!"

let statement = `Hi, my name is ${myName}, and I can't wait to visit ${dreamDestination}!`;

// Exercise 10. What is the data type of the value stored in 'dreamDestination',
// place your answer in the quotes below:

const myAnswerForExercise10 = "string";

// Exercise 11. What is the data type of the value stored in 'product',
// place your answer in the quotes below:

const myAnswerForExercise11 = "number";

// Exercise 12. What do you think the value of emptyVariable is?
// Place your answer below:

const myAnswerForExercise12 = "undefined";

// Exercise 13. If
const A = "R";
const B = 1;
const C = 4;
const D = "D";

// What is the value of B + C
const myAnswerForExercise13 = 5;

// Exercise 14 What is the value of
// A + "n" + D
const myAnswerForExercise14 = "RnD";

// Exercise 15 What is the value of
// A + B * 2 + D + C / 2:
const myAnswerForExercise15 = "R2D2";

// Exercise 16 What is the value of A * B
const myAnswerForExercise16 = NaN;

// Exercise 17 What is the value of true || false
const myAnswerForExercise17 = true;

// Exercise 18 What is the value of 1 === "1"
const myAnswerForExercise18 = false;

// Exercise 19 What is the value of 1 == "1"
const myAnswerForExercise19 = true;

// Exercise 20 What is the value of 1 < 1
const myAnswerForExercise20 = false;

// Exercise 21 What is the value of 1 < 2 < 3
const myAnswerForExercise21 = true;

// Exercise 22 What is the value of 2 < 1 < 3
const myAnswerForExercise22 = true;

// I was familiar with most of this, but needed some help from the chrome
